I am a student majoring in Information Systems at the University of AMIKOM Yogyakarta. When I was 18 years old, I had an interest in the world of programming. Starting with my interest in Python, I learned quite a lot of things including programming and now I'm working on web developing. My interest in web developing has made me learn many things until now, both on the front-end or back-end. During my development period, I studied Flask and React JS as my first entry into this field.</p>
